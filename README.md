# VBAUtilities
Just some VBA subs and functions that can be useful. Best use is probably to just copy and paste the full text file 'VBA Utilities - All.txt' into a module in your
personal macro workbook. At some point I will probably add more and organize them into separate modules. Most of these that are currently here were functions or scripts
I created while working at Strategic Comp.
